## Introduction

Stubble burning is a significant contributor to air pollution in India, releasing harmful pollutants and COâ‚‚, while negatively impacting public health. This project:

- Develops a machine learning model to predict stubble burning hotspots.
- Validates predictions through on-ground research and real-time data collection.
- Explores sustainable alternatives for farmers to reduce dependency on burning.

---

## Key Features

- **Prediction Model**: Identifies burning hotspots using geospatial and historical data.
- **On-Ground Validation**: Enhances prediction accuracy with real-world data verification.
- **Sustainable Alternatives**: Suggests repurposing crop residue for industrial use.
- **Implementation Framework**: Proposes logistical and economic solutions for farmer adoption.

## Methodology

The project employs the following approach:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensures quality and reliability of datasets.
2. **Data Verification**: Cross-validates predictions with ground-truth labels.
3. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Utilizes metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Indices Utilized**:
   - Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)
   - Burned Area Index (BAI)
   - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

---

## Results

- Achieved **53% prediction accuracy**, with high efficacy in identifying non-burned plots.
- Thousands of data points validated across multiple states.
- A **Django-based web application** developed for real-time data collection and validation.

---

## Future Scope

- **Refined Predictions**: Expand datasets to improve model accuracy.
- **Health Impact Studies**: Analyze the effects of stubble burning on air quality and public health.
- **Field Collaboration**: Strengthen partnerships with researchers for enhanced validation.
